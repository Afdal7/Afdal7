- 👋 Hi, I’m @Afdal7
- 👀 I’m interested in learning how GitHub works and how I can benefit from it.
- 🌱 I learned and created PHP application with MySQL (HTML, JavaScript, & CSS) last year. Currently, I want to refresh on the object oriented features of PHP (classes).
- 💞️ I’m looking for mentors (programmers, software engineers, etc.).
